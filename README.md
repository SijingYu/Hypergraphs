# Hypergraphs

Collection of hypergraphs from a variery of datasets. 

- *hypergraphs*: hypergraphs generated from each dataset, detailed description enclosed in each graph
- *raw-data*: folder containing all the original raw data, or slightly modified data, or only link to original source due to file size limit
- *cleaned-data*: folder containing the data cleaned from raw data. Depending on the specific dataset, it can be a direct cleaned version from the raw data and datasets, or a final version, or other data useful geared towards the purpose of generating hypergraphs.
- datasets: code of parsers, data manipulation (raw-data to cleaned-data), and hypergraph generation <\br>

** To use parsers/hypergraph_generators within the dataset folders, please include the *raw-data* folder to access required files. Some might need to be added manualy due to size limits of files, specified in each dataset.
