Since only we only focus on restaurant data, so all businesses are assigned new indices starting from 0, and these ids are used in the Yelp hypergraph. </br>
 *user-ids.txt* and *food_business.txt* can be generated by calling *parsers.py* within the Yelp dataset folder, and both are omitted due to size limit.
 *user-ids.txt* includes the assigned id (as a number) and the original id (as a string) of each user from the original data </br>
 *food_business.txt* includes the assigned id (as a number) and the original id (as a string) of each business which is a restaurant from the original data.
